# my-first-project

👋 Hey there! I'm currently diving into **Vue.js** and this repo is where I bring everything I learn into practice.

This is a **simple E-commerce website**, built from scratch as a hands-on learning project. It's not perfect — and that's the point. I'm learning by doing, and sharing the journey openly.

If you're also learning Vue, or just curious, feel free to check out the code.  
**Got feedback, tips, or resources that helped you learn Vue? I'd love to hear them!** ⭐

If you found this interesting or helpful in any way, feel free to star the repo and follow along as I grow 👣✨

## 🛣️ Learning Roadmap

I'm currently learning **Element Plus** as I recently started working at a company that uses it extensively. I'm actively integrating it into this e-commerce project to practice what I learn in real-time.

Check out my progress and ideas in the [Vue Learning Journey Board](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/projects/1)!

If you're experienced with Element Plus or Vue in general, I’d love your feedback — feel free to open an issue or drop a comment on one!
